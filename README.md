Math Quiz Game (Python – Tkinter GUI)

A GUI-based Math Quiz Game built using Python and Tkinter.
This project was developed as my second minor project during my Diploma in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) to strengthen my understanding of Python programming and GUI development.

📌 Project Overview

The Math Quiz Game presents users with randomly generated arithmetic questions.
The difficulty level increases as the user progresses, and the game tracks time and incorrect attempts to make learning more interactive and engaging.

🚀 Technologies Used

Python – Core programming logic

Tkinter – Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Random Module – Random question generation

Time Module – Timer functionality

✨ Features

User-friendly GUI interface

Random math questions

Three difficulty levels:

Easy

Medium

Hard

Timer to track total time taken

Wrong attempt tracking

Game over on incorrect hard-level answer

Option to play again or exit
