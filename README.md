# Maths-Quiz-Game
This project is a Math Quiz Game developed using Python and Tkinter. It generates random arithmetic questions with increasing difficulty levels. The project includes a timer, score tracking, and a user-friendly graphical interface. This is my second minor project created during my Diploma in Computer Science &amp; Engineering.
